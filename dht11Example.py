Assuming you are using a simple sensor like a temperature and humidity sensor (e.g., DHT11) connected to the GPIO pins:
"""

import dht
import machine
import time

sensor = dht.DHT11(machine.Pin(23))  # Replace with the GPIO pin you connected the sensor to

# Main loop
try:

            sensor.measure()
            temperature = sensor.temperature()
            humidity = sensor.humidity()
    
            # Print sensor data
            print(f'Temperature: {temperature}Â°C, Humidity: {humidity}%')
